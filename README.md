# jacobsz
A DOM manipulation library for [Batavia](https://github.com/pybee/batavia), based on jQuery's API.

## Origin of name
The Batavia project is named after the *Batavia* ship of the Dutch East India Company, which suffered from a famous mutiny on her maiden voyage... all because skipper Ariaen **Jacobsz** wanted to take over the ship and *get away from Java*.

Seems a fair name for a library designed to help steer frontend development on the direction its user wants.
